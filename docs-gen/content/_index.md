# Vehicle Signal Specification

The Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) is an initiative by [COVESA](https://www.covesa.global/) to define a syntax and a catalogue for vehicle signals.
The source code and releases can be found in the [VSS github repository](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification).
Some tools for parsing and converting VSS files can be found in the [VSS-tools github repository](https://github.com/COVESA/vss-tools).

This documentation gives you an overview of VSS:

* [Introduction](/vehicle_signal_specification/introduction) </br> Read this part if you want to know more
about what the specification is all about, what's in and out and how to quickly
 browse through the current status.
* [Rule Set](/vehicle_signal_specification/rule_set) </br> Get familiar with the rule set behind the
specification, the structure, the format and concepts. Basic knowledge needed
to write first extensions.
* [Ecosystem](/vehicle_signal_specification/ecosystem) How to use the specification? Check out the existing tools and standards to transform or make use of VSS.
